# useful-php-snippits
A small collection of very simple, reusable PHP snippits I created and find useful. Released under The Unlicense.

I not massively skilled in PHP in any way, so it's completely possible things in here aren't the most elegant or correct way to implement the desired functionality. However, I figured if I'm going to keeping snippits for my own use, I might as well make it public for anyone else looking to find similar functionality.

These are completely free to use as per the license, however I'd love to know if you do use any of this stuff for your own work :)
